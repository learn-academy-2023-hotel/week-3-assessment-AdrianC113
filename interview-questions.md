# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is the bridge language found in react used to communicate javascript languages. The syntax difference between HTML and JSX is that HTML uses "" quotations to encompass code while JSX uses the {} curly brackets. 

Researched answer: JSX is a language structure that resembles HTML and allows HTML features to run within the javascript code. This simplifies the code and makes it easier to read. JSX is like HTML in many ways. it's different in certain syntax, specifically in Javascript's protected words. An example of a Javascript protected word is "class" in which case, JSX will use className to differentiate syntax. While HTML uses quotations in its code, JSX requires the curly brackets to be defined. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a packaged used in Javascript to test your codes against other codes created by other developers. The files that are modified when you run the command yarn in the terminal is the test.js. Test.js allows the code to be ran and tested which returns a good failed code in which you can re-code and correct to receive a good passing code. 

Researched answer: Yarn is a Javascript package manager that has a collection of code from other developers called dependencies. The files that are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal are package.json and yarn.lock. Additionally, a new directory will be created called node_modules which will house the codes of each package.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are used to house user inputs while creating changes and updating the value depending on the given function created by the developer. Props, short for properties, is used to pass information from one component to its dependent component. 

Researched answer: State values are constantly changing data stored in a component. The data within state can be changed depending on user inputs and can be accomplished by using a React Hook called "useState". Props, short for properties, is used to pass data from the parent component to its dependent component. It gives a connection between components and allows a flow of communication. 

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Researched answer: div tags are used to house larger blocks of code while span tags are used for smaller in-line types of codes. Span tags can be used to change the attributes of a specific line or a portion of text within the code while a div tag can conveniently house a group of blocks and implement a style change to a bigger collection of code or text.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. DOM: Document Object Model is what translates the JavaScript code into our web pages. It acts like a blueprint that’s made up of all the parts and features of a webpage. This allows developers to peak into and read its contents, make changes, and add more using JavaScript. 

2. Object-oriented programming: OOP is based on four pillars: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It is considered the building blocks to writing code. OOP ensures that codes are easier to manage and understand, due to its organized structure encompassing a combination of data and functions.

3. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language that’s well known for its clean and easy to read structure. Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, he focused on the programmer's happiness thus creating a language that makes it simple for programmers to interpret and use. This boosts productivity and garners support from large communities in the tech space.
